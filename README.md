# **Water Quality Prediction**

## **Overview**  
This project predicts water quality based on various physicochemical parameters using machine learning techniques. It provides insights into water contamination levels and supports decision-making for maintaining safe water standards.

---

## **Features**
- Predicts water quality (e.g., potable or not) using Random Forest Classifier.  
- Analyzes key parameters influencing water quality.  
- Visualizes data insights and prediction results.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy  
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Random Forest

## **Workflow**
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and scaling.  
   - Visualize parameter distributions and correlations.  

2. **Model Training**:  
   - Train a Random Forest Classifier for predicting water quality.  
   - Evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

3. **Feature Importance**:  
   - Identify significant features contributing to water quality predictions.

4. **Visualization**:  
   - Display results and insights through plots and feature importance charts.

## **Future Enhancements**
- Explore other machine learning models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, SVM).  
- Integrate with a web application for user-friendly predictions.  
- Add support for real-time water quality monitoring systems.
